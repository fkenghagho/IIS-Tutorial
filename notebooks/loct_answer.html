        <h2 class="section-title text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Effects of Individual Changes to the System</h2>

        <!-- Non-Holonomic -->
        <div class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">1. The platform is non-holonomic</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Effect: The movement is constrained such that the direction of velocity is always aligned with the robot's current heading. This means the motion model used to predict the next state is inherently non-linear.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                Solvability: Yes, it is still solvable, but requires a non-linear estimation technique.
                A standard Linear Kalman Filter cannot handle this non-linearity. You must use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), which use approximation or sampling techniques to correctly propagate the uncertainty through the non-linear motion function.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Noise in Actuators (Wheel Slip) -->
        <div class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">2. There is noise in the actuators (wheel slip)</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Effect: Wheel slip introduces unmodeled, random error into the motion estimates derived from odometry. The actual movement will differ from the movement commanded by the control input.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                Solvability: Yes, it is still solvable.
                This effect is modeled directly by the Process Noise Covariance Matrix. To account for higher slip uncertainty, you must increase the values of this matrix corresponding to the motion states (position, heading). A larger process noise value ensures the filter trusts its prediction less and remains receptive to corrections from sensor measurements.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Robot is able to perform rotations around the z axis -->
        <div class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow-md">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">3. The robot is able to perform rotations around the vertical axis</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Effect: The robot's orientation (heading) around the vertical axis becomes a critical, estimated part of the robot's state. This introduces a non-linearity due to the required trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) used in the motion model to calculate global movement from local movement.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                Solvability: Yes, it is solvable.
                It requires expanding the state vector to include the orientation and using an Extended Kalman Filter or Unscented Kalman Filter to handle the resulting non-linear motion model.

    <!-- Section 2: Specific Questions -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="section-title text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Specific Theoretical Questions</h2>

        <!-- Question 4: Sigma_0 = 0 (Math Removed) -->
        <div class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">4. What is the meaning of the initial uncertainty matrix being zero?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                A zero initial uncertainty matrix means the filter is initialized with absolute certainty in the robot's starting position and state. The filter assumes it knows the robot's state perfectly.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                Consequences: This is generally bad practice and causes divergence. If the initial uncertainty is zero, the filter calculates that it should ignore new measurements. It will be unable to correct any small initial positioning errors, leading to the estimated position drifting away from the true position as the robot moves. The filter will remain overconfident in an incorrect state.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 5: Multiple same measurements (Math Removed) -->
        <div class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">5. Do multiple measurements in a short time with the exact same results improve the belief?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Yes, they improve the belief, but with diminishing returns.
                Each measurement provides an opportunity to reduce the state uncertainty, even if the result is the same. The repeated application averages out the sensor noise more quickly, leading to a smaller overall uncertainty. However, as uncertainty shrinks, the filter begins to trust its internal model more, meaning subsequent, identical measurements have less and less impact on the final belief.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 6: Inverse Kinematics Probability (Math Removed) -->
        <div class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">6. How difficult is it to express the likelihood of the next state given the current state and control, and what would your approach be? What does this likelihood express?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                - It quantifies the likelihood of a specific commanded control input being the cause of the system's observed transition from its previous state to its current state.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
               - Expressing this probability is Highly Difficult because it represents an Ill-Posed Inverse Problem.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                - Approach: Conceptual Breakdown using Bayes' Rule<br>

P(Ut | Xt-1, Xt) = P(Xt | Xt-1, Ut) x P(Ut | Xt-1)/ Sum over U' of P(Xt | U't, Xt-1)
 
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 7: Distance vs. Velocity Sensor (Math Removed) -->
        <div class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">7. Does replacing the integrated distance sensor with velocity sensor improve the filter behaviour? Justify your claim.</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Claim: Yes, replacing an integrated distance sensor with an instantaneous velocity sensor generally improves filter behavior.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                Justification:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-600">
                    <li>Reduced Cumulative Error: Integrated distance (odometry) inherently suffers from cumulative error—errors from each small time step accumulate and cause drift. A velocity sensor provides direct, instantaneous feedback on the rate of change, which helps the filter damp out transient errors (like wheel slip) more quickly, leading to a more accurate, stable belief.</li>
                    <li>Direct State Observability: If the filter's state includes velocity, the velocity sensor directly measures these states, simplifying the measurement model and improving the system's ability to correct its belief.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 8: No measurements over a long period (Math Removed) -->
        <div class="bg-white p-5 rounded-lg shadow-md">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">8. What are the consequences for the belief if there are no measurements over a long period of time?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                If there are no measurements, the filter continuously executes only the Prediction Step (Motion Model).
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                Consequences for the Belief:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-1 text-gray-600">
                    <li>Uncertainty Growth: Since the process noise is constantly being added with every prediction step, the total uncertainty will grow indefinitely. The belief's certainty rapidly degrades.</li>
                    <li>State Drift: The estimated mean position will drift away from the true position. This divergence is caused by the accumulated error from the motion model and unmodeled dynamics.</li>
                </ul>
                The belief becomes completely unreliable without periodic measurement corrections to bound the uncertainty.
